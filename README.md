# Windows-8-Activator
How to use this script:

Using it is really easy.

Put the file inside your desktop and run it as administrator

wait a while for it to connect to the KMS server and when it does your windows 8 OS will be activated!

Sometimes the script can connect or the server is down. If so wait for a few minutes and it will work!
